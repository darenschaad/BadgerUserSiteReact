          Hello.
We are the Badgers.
We are an adult scout troop.
Our motto is simple: Do Cool Shit.
So what do you want to do?
. . . submit a new or completed badge?

Go straight to the Badgers Form here.

. . . see what Badgers are up to?
Weve been busy Badgers lately -- Snow Sporting, Volunteering, Giving Blood, Getting Geeky, Touring Distilleries, and all kinds of adventures! Check out some of our recent activities here.
Visit the Badgers Calendar here.
See the Big List o' Badges here!
If you see an activity that's on the list and you'd like to earn it with a group of other Badgers, announce it at a Badgers meeting or get on the email distribution list and let's make it happen!
. . . get busy doing stuff?
Use the Badgers Form or come to a Badgers meeting to:
introduce yourself as a new Badger
add ideas for badges that are not on the list, and
report the completion of a badge!

We meet every 3rd Friday.
See the Badgers Calendar for details.
Our monthly meetings are an excellent opportunity to:
Show your work
Receive your badges and Badger Books
Drink some wine and eat some snacks
Conspire and collaborate
We often have small activities at the meetings, but most badge-earning activities take place outside of these meetings (independently, organized between Badgers, or using the distribution list).
You can see all group activities on the Badgers Calendar here.
